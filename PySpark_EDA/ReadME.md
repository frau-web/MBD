# Crime Analysis in PySpark 

**Purpose:** The purpose of this project was to analysis a large dataset in detail using PySpark. 
I chose to conduct a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis on 2.2 Million crime records in Los Angeles, USA between 2010 and 2019 to understand the development of crime as well when, how and to whom crimes happen. 
The analysis was conducted using PySpark and Spark infrastructure, with a focus on data exploration, handling null or missing values, grouping, filtering, joins, strings handling. 
This analysis was done as individual assignment during the Master in Business Analytics & Big Data at IE University.
