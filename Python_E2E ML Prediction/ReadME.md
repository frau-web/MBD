# [Work-in-Progress] End-to-End Machine Learning: Energy Price Prediction

**Purpose:** 
This project is set up as an end-to-end Machine Learning Project to predict day-ahead energy prices in Spain using Regression techniques. It is divided into three parts: 
1. Intro & EDA
2. Featue Engineering and Transformation
3. Prediction using Regression techniques

This analysis is based on a group work during the Master in Business Analytics and Big Data at IE University, Madrid and is currently being completely reworked and summarized by myself following the hand-in of the project. 

**Dataset:** provided by the university

**Language used:** Python

**Main Libraries used:** Pandas, Numpy, Scikit Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Tasks:
#### Part I: Intro & Exploratory Data Analysis [WIP]

- Intro to the Spanish energy market
- Detailed Data Exploration incl. visualizations
- First Baseline Model

#### Part II: Feature Engineering & Transformation 
to come

#### Part III: Prediction using Regression techniques
to come
