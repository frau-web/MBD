# Python EDA

**Purpose:** 
- Perform EDA on the Titanic Dataset and identify a strategy to impute missing values
- class assignment during the Master in Business Analytics & Big Data, Python Class

**Dataset:** Titanic Train Dataset (Source: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data?select=train.csv)

**Language used:** Python

##Tasks:
#### Part I: Exploratory analysis

- Read the dataset correctly using pandas, using an appropriate column as index
- Compute the percentage of survivors out of total number of passengers and the percentage of men and women out of total number of passengers
- Compute the percentage of survivors by sex (i.e. the percentage of male passengers that survived and female passengers that survived) and the sex distribution of survivors (i.e. percentage of survivors that were men and percentage of survivors that were women)
- Display in a 2 x 2 DataFrame the probability of being male/female and surviving/not surviving

##### Part II: Imputing missing values
Devise some strategy to impute the missing values in the Age column.
You cannot use machine learning algorithms for the feature engineering part, only manual techniques. This rules out KNN, Deep Learning, sklearn.preprocessing.Imputer, fancyimpute, missingno, and similar.
