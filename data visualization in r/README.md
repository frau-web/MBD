# Data Visualization in R

**Purpose:** The purpose of this project was to develop a data story using R language (mainly ggplot) and available visualizations. 
The code is part of a group assignment for the during the Master in Business Analytics & Big Data and was fully written by me. 

**Dataset:** https://www.ctdatacollaborative.org/ 

**Language used:** R
**Main Libraries used:** ggplot2, gganimate, ggthemes, tidyr, dplyr, tidyverse


## Tasks:
Develop a data story and fitting visualizations in R.

## Comments:
It is important to mention that the visualizations show only reported human trafficking cases and it can be assumed that the actual numbers are much higher. Additionally, given the sensitive nature of the topic, the dataset is in large parts incomplete and highly anonymized. Imputing those missing values was considered as inappropriate and rather an underlying feature of the data which tells its own story: the difficulty in getting a grip on human trafficking.
