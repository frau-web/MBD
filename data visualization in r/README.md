# Data Visualization in R

The purpose of this project was to develop a data story using R language (mainly ggplot) and available visualizations. 

The dataset was chosen from: https://www.ctdatacollaborative.org/ 

Given the sensitive nature of the topic, the dataset is in large parts incomplete and highly anonymized. 
It is important to mention that the visualizations show only reported human trafficking cases and it can be assumed that the actual numbers are much higher.
