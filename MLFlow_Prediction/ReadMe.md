# Predicting Wine Quality using KNN & ML Flow

**Purpose:** The purpose of this project was to predict the wine quality as a function of the rest of the attributes using K-NN with MLFlow and to examine the results with MLFlow UI comparing the different runs.

**Instructions**:
- Download the dataset from here: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009
- Install necessary libraries incl. MLFlow
- Execute the notebook
- After training and predicting, run $mlflow in the command line and open the ML Flow Tracking UI. The Tracking UI lets us visualize, search and compare the previously 7 calculated runs as well as download run artifacts or metadata for analysis in other tools.

**Language used:** Python
